# Overview
In this guided project, provided by [dataquest.io](https://app.dataquest.io/m/155/guided-project%3A-predicting-car-prices/1/introduction-to-the-data-set), I attempt to predict car prices using the KNN's algorithm and practice a basic data science workflow based on this [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile) provided by UCI.

The data provides information about the different features of a car (make, model, horsepower, etc.) and the price back in 1985. All info about the dataset can be found on the UCI link above, explaining the meanings of certain columns and where they sourced the data.
