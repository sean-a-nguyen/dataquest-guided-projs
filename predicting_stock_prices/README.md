# Introduction

In this guided project, we will work with data from the S&P 500 Index. With these future prices, it can help us forecast how the stock market performs as a whole and even with economic forecasts (since the economy tends to correlate with how well the stock market performs). 

**The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model to predict future prices.**
