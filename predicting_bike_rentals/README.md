# Introduction
Many cities have communal biking sharing stations where you can either rent by hour or day. This dataset we'll be working with was compiled by Hadi Fanaee-T at the University of Porto. It contains 17380 rows and each row represents the number of bike rentals for a single hour of a single day. 

The data can be found at the UCI machine learning respository, [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

**The goal of this project is to predict the number of bikes rented in a given hour.** Using a linear regression, decision tree, and random forest, we will see which model produces the best results.
