# Overview
In this guided project, provided by [dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&matchtype=e&device=c&utm_campaign=brandsearch&campaignid=2083591861&adgroupid=75850930719&adid=482446438765&gclid=CjwKCAiA1eKBBhBZEiwAX3gqlyuDrPWpagl8x_afwfks_x7SSr9xGRzV9CbTr-jv9jDQpvm5_yNqgRoCpR0QAvD_BwE), I answered some general business questions for a music store, Chinook, with information from their database containing employee, customer, invoice and music information. 

To pull information from the database, I used SQLite. For some basic data visualizations, I used the following Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, and numpy. 

The questions we are interested in are as follows:
1. Given 4 new albums, which albums should Chinook add to their store?
2. Who had the top sales performance amongst the sales agents?
3. Which countries had the most sales?
4. Chinook is looking to change their purchasing strategy, so are individual track sales or album sales more popular?
5. Which artist is used in the most playlists?
6. How many tracks have been purchased vs not purchased?
7. Is the range of tracks in the store reflective of their sales popularity?
8. Do protected vs. non-protected media types have an effect on popularity?
